## Usage

### Export Metadata

Export metadata from MP3 files to a CSV file:

python3 transfer-mp3md.py export <mp3_directory> <output_csv>

* If `<output_csv>` exists, metadata is appended based on matching filenames.
* If `<output_csv>` does not exist, a new file is created.

### Import Metadata

Import metadata from a CSV file into your MP3 files:

python3 transfer-mp3md.py import <input_csv> <mp3_directory>

The tool matches MP3 files with the filenames listed in the CSV and updates their metadata accordingly.

## CSV Format

The CSV file includes the following columns:

* `filename`
* `title`
* `artist`
* `album`
* `tracknumber`
* `genre`
* `date`
* `composer`
* `comments`

Empty fields are left blank in the CSV, not replaced with `nan`.
